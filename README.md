# Hello

Hello, this is my repository, with my tasks.
You can try to solve some of that.

# How to start?
  git clone https://github.com/ZzOneDay/Tasks.git

# Some rules:
1. Main idea of complete task - your solution will pass all tests.
2. If interface name "Task001" use naming like as "Task001Impl" for class with code.

Have a nice day :)

# Tasks:
1. Deliveryman with QuadCopter.
